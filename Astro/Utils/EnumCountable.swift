/**
 EnumCountable provides an easy way to add a static count constant to Swift enums of type Int.
 
 It requires that the first case start at 0 and all cases must be continuous.
 
 Usage:
 ```
 enum MyEnum: Int, EnumCountable {
    case case1 = 0
    case case2
    case case3
 
    static let count = MyEnum.countCases()  // Lazy-initialize the constant 'count' to the number of enum cases
 }
 ```
 */
public protocol EnumCountable {
    static var count: Int { get }
}

public extension EnumCountable where Self : RawRepresentable, Self.RawValue == Int {
    
    /**
    Counts the number of cases in the enum, starting at 0
    */
    static func countCases() -> Int {
        var count = 0
        while let _ = Self(rawValue: count) {
            count += 1
        }
        return count
    }
}
