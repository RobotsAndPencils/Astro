/**
 EnumCountable allows you to add a "count" constant to Swift enums of type Int.
 
 Requirements:
 - The enum must be of type Int
 - The first case must start at 0  
 - All cases must be continous
 
 Usage:
 enum MyEnum: Int, EnumCountable {
    case case1 = 0
    case case2
    case case3
 
    static let count = MyEnum.countCases()  // Lazy-initialize the constant 'count' to the number of enum cases
 }
 */

public protocol EnumCountable {
    static var count : Int { get }
}

public extension EnumCountable where Self : RawRepresentable, Self.RawValue == Int {
    
    // Counts the number of cases in the enum, starting at 0
    static func countCases() -> Int {
        var count = 0
        while let _ = Self(rawValue: count) {
            count += 1
        }
        return count
    }
}
