/**
 Encapsulates a change between two values of the same type

 Sometimes you need the old and new values of a property in order to perform
 efficient or pleasing changes elsewhere, like in your UI. This type makes that
 simpler by allowing you to pass a single value around. It's then possible to
 get sub-changes with the `change[at: \.value]` subscript.

 ## Example

 ```
 var model: ViewModel {
   didSet {
     let change = Change(old: oldValue, new: model)
     updateUI(with: change)
   }
 }

 func updateUI(with change: Change<Model>) {
   title = change.new.title
   updateSomeSubview(with: change[at: \.subviewState])
   // ...
 }

 func updateSomeSubview(with change: Change<SubviewState>) {
   guard change.isDifferent else { return }
   // ...
 }
 ```
 */
public struct Change<Value> {
    public let old: Value
    public let new: Value

    public init(old: Value, new: Value) {
        self.old = old
        self.new = new
    }

    /**
     Create a Change between old and new child values at a particular key path
     */
    public subscript<ChildValue>(at keyPath: KeyPath<Value, ChildValue>) -> Change<ChildValue> {
        return Change<ChildValue>(old: old[keyPath: keyPath], new: new[keyPath: keyPath])
    }
}

extension Change where Value: Equatable {
    public var isDifferent: Bool {
        return old != new
    }
}
